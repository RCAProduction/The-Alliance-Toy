HTTP API:
	Make it OO,
	Use STL (i.e std::string for url, etc)

RequestBroker:
	APIRequest:
		Standard StatusParser and Status object ( {Status: 0, Error = "Danger, Will Robinson!"} )
	Request:
		Some way of identifying multiple requests destined for the same listener

Client/Server API:
	Make more use of APIRequest so we can get rid of the pooey, flakey threading in PreviewView, etc

Interface General:
	Try to use the "Activity" model for some simpler interfaces instead of code-heavy M-V-C
	Move interfaces into separate folder

Interface Elements:

	Vertical Scrolling for Textbox
	
Add http://bmnnet.tk:3001/  Or http://vps3.wolfy1330.tk:3001/ as server option

04:25] <Powder99999_> If you could somehow code it how you want it, what would it be like?
[04:25] <RCA> Just like a normal sign
[04:25] <RCA> Maybe purple?
[04:25] <RCA> Idk
[04:25] <RCA> CLick it and it goes to the ID
[04:26] <Powder99999_> An element that does that would be a good idea
[04:26] <RCA> But it's special because we would use it to link to hidden galaxy mod saves
[04:26] <RCA> I could make an element that goes to the correct ID based off of tmp fairly easily I think
[04:27] <RCA> But you need to set tmp
[04:27] <Powder99999_> If it was an element you could have stars or planets that you click on to go to their save.
[04:27] <RCA> Yeah
[04:27] <RCA> Maybe make it like LCRY
[04:27] <RCA> Be able to turn on or off
